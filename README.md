## ⚙️ Framework Features

- Reusable request specification
- Environment-based configuration
- POJO model usage for request/response
- Centralized base test structure
- Clean service layer abstraction
- TestNG suite execution support
- Reporting integration ready
- CI/CD friendly design

---

## 🧪 Test Design Approach

- Positive test scenarios
- Negative test scenarios

- Response body validation
- Status code verification
- Header validation

---

## ▶️ How To Run Tests

### Run all tests

mvn clean test


---

### Run specific TestNG suite

mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml


---

### Run tests from IDE

- Run test classes directly
- Run TestNG suite file
- Run individual test methods

---

## 🌍 Environment Configuration

Configuration values such as base URL, authentication details, and environment parameters are stored in configuration files.

This allows:

- Running tests across multiple environments
- Easy configuration management
- Separation of test logic and environment data

---

## 📊 Reporting

The framework supports test reporting integrations such as:

- TestNG Reports
- Allure Reports (optional integration)

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

The project is designed to run seamlessly in CI pipelines.

The CI pipeline automatically runs API tests on every code change to ensure the automation framework remains stable.

Example execution:

mvn clean test


The framework can be integrated into:

- Jenkins
- GitLab CI
- Azure DevOps

---

## 📌 Design Principles

- Maintainability
- Readability
- Reusability
- Scalability
- Clean architecture
